Upon graduation, Matthew commssioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Active Duty Component through UCF Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in May of 2015. Matthewâ€™s research interests are broad. His previous interests were in Latin American politics and political methodology. Broadly, that research examined ways to integrate interdisciplinary approaches to find the nexus between the psycho-social identity in post conflict societies.

His hope is to pursue an advanced degree in Science and Technology Policy in order to research ways to get people of low income backgrounds more involved in technological innovation and entrepreneurial business formation.
